# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-Pandas_Profiling
Pandas profiling is an open source Python module with which we can quickly do an exploratory data analysis with just a few lines of code. Besides, if this is not enough to convince us to use this tool, it also generates interactive reports in web format that can be presented to any person, even if they donâ€™t know programming.

The main disadvantage of pandas profiling is its use with large datasets. With the increase in the size of the data the time to generate the report also increases a lot.
